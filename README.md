# Desamber

On XXIIVV, dates are written using a variance of the International Fixed Calendar and a custom convention to move the English months' names, away from those of Greek gods'.

The Equal Month calendar format has 13 months and so the number of each of these months are flected into their names.

01	Unesamber	08	Octesamber
02	Dutesamber	09	Novesamber
03	Trisesamber	10	Desamber
04	Tetresamber	11	Undesamber
05	Pentesamber	12	Dodesamber
06	Hexesamber	13	Tridesamber
07	Sevesamber

Every month is 28 days long, and the 365th day of the year is the Year Day, followed by the Leap Day on leap years. Below are a few exmples of gregorian dates alongside their Desamber equivalences.
