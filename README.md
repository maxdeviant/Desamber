# Desamber

On [XXIIVV](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Oscean), dates are written using a variance of the International Fixed Calendar and a custom convention to move the English months' names, away from those of Greek gods.

The *Equal Month calendar* format has 13 months and so the number of each of these months are reflected in their names.

**Every month is 28 days long**, and the 365th day of the year is the Year Day, followed by the Leap Day on leap years. Below are a few exmples of gregorian dates alongside their Desamber equivalents.
